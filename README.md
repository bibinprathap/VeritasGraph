# VeritasGraph  
**Enterprise-Grade Graph RAG for Secure, On-Premise AI with Verifiable Attribution**

VeritasGraph is a production-ready, end-to-end framework for building advanced question-answering and summarization systems that operate entirely within your private infrastructure.  

It is architected to overcome the fundamental limitations of traditional vector-search-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging a knowledge graph to perform complex, multi-hop reasoning.  

Baseline RAG systems excel at finding direct answers but falter when faced with questions that require connecting disparate information or understanding a topic holistically. **VeritasGraph addresses this challenge directly, providing not just answers, but transparent, auditable reasoning paths with full source attribution for every generated claim, establishing a new standard for trust and reliability in enterprise AI.**

## 1. Core Capabilities  

VeritasGraph integrates four critical components into a cohesive, powerful, and secure system:  

- **Multi-Hop Graph Reasoning** â€“ Move beyond semantic similarity to traverse complex relationships within your data.  
- **Efficient LoRA-Tuned LLM** â€“ Fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient, powerful on-premise deployment.  
- **End-to-End Source Attribution** â€“ Every statement is linked back to specific source documents and reasoning paths.  
- **Secure & Private On-Premise Architecture** â€“ Fully deployable within your infrastructure, ensuring data sovereignty.  

---

## 2. The Architectural Blueprint: From Unstructured Data to Attributed Insights  

The VeritasGraph pipeline transforms unstructured documents into a structured knowledge graph for attributable reasoning.  

### **Stage 1: Automated Knowledge Graph Construction**  
- **Document Chunking** â€“ Segment input docs into granular `TextUnits`.  
- **Entity & Relationship Extraction** â€“ LLM extracts structured triplets `(head, relation, tail)`.  
- **Graph Assembly** â€“ Nodes + edges stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j).  

### **Stage 2: The Hybrid Retrieval Engine**  
- **Query Analysis & Entry-Point Identification** â€“ Vector search finds relevant entry nodes.  
- **Contextual Expansion via Multi-Hop Traversal** â€“ Graph traversal uncovers hidden relationships.  
- **Pruning & Re-Ranking** â€“ Removes noise, keeps most relevant facts for reasoning.  

### **Stage 3: The LoRA-Tuned Reasoning Core**  
- **Augmented Prompting** â€“ Context formatted with query, sources, and instructions.  
- **LLM Generation** â€“ Locally hosted, LoRA-tuned open-source model generates attributed answers.  
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning** â€“ Specialization for reasoning + attribution with efficiency.  

### **Stage 4: The Attribution & Provenance Layer**  
- **Metadata Propagation** â€“ Track source IDs, chunks, and graph nodes.  
- **Traceable Generation** â€“ Model explicitly cites sources.  
- **Structured Attribution Output** â€“ JSON object with provenance + reasoning trail.

## 3. Beyond Semantic Search: Solving the Multi-Hop Challenge  

Traditional RAG fails at complex reasoning (e.g., linking an engineer across projects and patents).  
VeritasGraph succeeds by combining:  

- **Semantic search** â†’ finds entry points.  
- **Graph traversal** â†’ connects the dots.  
- **LLM reasoning** â†’ synthesizes final answer with citations.
